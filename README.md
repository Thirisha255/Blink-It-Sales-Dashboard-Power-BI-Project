 ## Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes BlinkItâ€™s sales data to uncover insights into item trends, outlet performance, customer ratings, and sales distribution. The goal was to transform raw retail data into a dynamic, interactive dashboard that supports data-driven decisions.
## Data Files
- dataset.xlsx: Original Excel data used in Power BI
- dataset.csv: Converted version for quick previewÂ onÂ GitHub

##  Tools & Technologies Used
- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query Editor (for data cleaning and transformation)
- DAX (for calculated KPIs and measures)
- Data Profiling (to assess and improve data quality)
- Visualizations (pie charts, bar charts, funnel charts, line charts)
##  Dataset Information
**The dataset consists of retail-level item and outlet data with the following columns:**
Item Fat Content, Item Identifier, Item Type, Outlet Establishment Year, Outlet Identifier
Outlet Location Tier, Outlet Size, Outlet Type, Item Visibility, Item Weight, Sales, Rating
##  Data Preparation
-Using Power Query Editor, I performed the following data-cleaning steps:
-Replaced inconsistent text values (e.g., standardizing fat content categories)
-Renamed columns for clarity
-Fixed data types (e.g., numbers, dates, text)
-Checked data quality using Power BI's "Column quality" and "Column distribution" features
-Filtered unnecessary or null values for improved accuracy
##  KPIs Created
**I designed key performance indicators (KPIs) for high-level insights:**
- Total Sales: $1.2M
- Average Sales per Item: $140.99
- Number of Items Sold: 9K
- Average Rating: 3.92
##  Visualizations & Charts
**To explore and communicate insights, I created the following charts:**
ðŸ”¸ Pie Charts:
Total Sales by Item Fat Content
Total Sales by Outlet Size
ðŸ”¹ Bar Charts:
Total Sales by Item Type
Total Sales by Outlet Location Tier
Item Fat Content by Outlet Tier
ðŸ“‰ Line Chart:
Total Sales by Outlet Establishment Year (2010â€“2020)
ðŸ”» Funnel Chart:
Total Sales by Outlet Location
##  Filters:
- Item Type
- Item Identifier
##  Key Insights
- Regular fat-content items make up over 64% of total sales.
- Fruits and Vegetables are the top-selling item category, followed closely by Snack Foods.
- Tier 3 outlets generate the most revenue, contributing over $472K in sales.
- Most outlets were established after 2015, and those newer outlets show increasing sales trends.
- Small and medium-sized outlets comprise over 75% of total sales, highlighting their importance in the Blink It network.
- ## What I Learned
**This project helped me improve my practical Power BI skills in:**
- Cleaning and transforming real-world datasets
- Designing KPIs and choosing appropriate visuals
